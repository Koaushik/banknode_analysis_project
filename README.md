# Analyzing Banking Trends: Customer Transactions and Regional Impact

In the dynamic landscape of banking and finance, understanding customer behavior and its regional impact is pivotal for informed decision-making and strategic planning. The "Analyzing Banking Trends: Customer Transactions and Regional Impact" project aims to extract valuable insights from transaction data, shedding light on customer behavior patterns and their potential implications on different world regions.

## Objective

The core objective of this project is to delve into customer transactions and discern trends that may influence regional economies and financial systems. By employing data cleaning techniques in Python and utilizing SQL queries on a set of interlinked tables, we seek to gain a comprehensive understanding of how customer transactions vary across different regions and the possible repercussions on the banking sector.

## Data Sources

This project relies on three central tables that provide critical information for analysis:

1. **world_regions table**: Contains data on various world regions, including their corresponding codes and names. It serves as a reference to categorize customers based on their regional affiliation.

2. **user_nodes table**: Holds essential details about consumers' banking nodes, including their unique consumer IDs, associated region IDs, node IDs, start dates, and end dates. This data enables us to identify the specific banking nodes to which customers are connected and the duration of their association.

3. **user_transaction table**: A comprehensive repository of customer transactions, encompassing data such as consumer IDs, transaction dates, types of transactions, and transaction amounts. Analyzing this data empowers us to uncover patterns in customer spending and financial behaviors.

## Project Structure

The project comprises several key components:

1. **Data Cleaning (Python)**: Initial data cleaning is performed using Python, focusing on tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data integrity.

2. **SQL Queries**: SQL queries are employed to extract and analyze relevant information from the interconnected tables. This includes tasks like aggregating transaction data, identifying trends, and performing regional impact assessments.

3. **Insights and Visualizations**: The derived data is further processed to generate actionable insights. Visualizations may be employed to facilitate a clear understanding of the trends uncovered.

4. **Recommendations and Strategy**: Based on the insights gained, recommendations and strategic considerations may be proposed. These could include suggestions for regional banking initiatives, customer engagement strategies, and more.

## Conclusion

Through a combination of Python data cleaning techniques and SQL analysis, this project endeavors to provide valuable insights into customer behavior and its impact on various world regions. By understanding these trends, financial institutions can make informed decisions and formulate strategies that are attuned to both customer preferences and regional dynamics.
